  %p.title our mission
  %p 
    to go around the globe, travel through hyperspace, find a new worlds created by the minds of extraordinary people. to collect snapshots of everything we can record and present them to our readers. to find things that will get the attention of our readers, make them stop and notice something new. it’s not about screaming or surprising people — all this you can find in modern art museum. it’s not about scrolling through and meaningless sharing on social networks — people have plenty of this already. it’s about opening the imagination through the visual beauty of the world, of the moment. it’s about being mindful.
